## Project Description
The project contains unit tests for the Python files `circle.py`, `square.py`, and `triangle.py`. 
The tests check the correctness of the following functions:
- `area()` — the area of a shape,
- `perimeter()` — the perimeter of a shape.

To automate the check, I use **CI/CD** through **GitHub Actions** that runs tests every time you push to the repository.
